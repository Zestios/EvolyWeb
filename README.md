# EvolyWeb
This is my first **solo project**, I built everything from start to finish.
I made the design as well as the code.

This project makes use of the following :
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- SASS (SCSS)

Also relevant to mention :
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- BEM methodology (naming convention)
- Media queries for responsive design

Here's what I learned by building this project :
I learned to make use of a good HTML structure for implementing **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**. On this project, I used the **BEM** methodology and its naming convention. In my opinion, it makes the code extremely easy to understand. I also tried to implement some **SEO**, but still struggle to understand it... Responsiveness on mobile was harder than I thought, even though I made extensive use of REM units, Flexbox and CSS Grid. I also learned many useful tools such as **NPM Scripts**, **Git/GitHub**, using the command line.

Things I should learn/improve upon after building this project :
I'm not satisfied with my use of CSS Grid and Flexbox, but I'm confident that I did good for my very first project. That was my first time implementing responsiveness, I don't think I did well in that area. I want to understand SEO and how it should be implemented. In this project, I purposely set aside 2 things: **JavaScript** and the **contact form** at the end. I wanted to make the contact form work, but decided against it for this project. Additionally, I laid the groundwork to implement a FAQ section with a JavaScript toggle to show/hide the answers (Using the **+/- signs**). In the end, I set it aside to focus on the essential parts of the website instead. I might implement this feature later, or simply keep it in mind for another project. For any future project, my next step is **JavaScript** and **PHP**.
