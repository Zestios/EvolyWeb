							components: <span class="font-bold">plenty of spacing</span> between elements and
							<span class="font-bold">strictly necessary content</span>. Combining those

						<p class="paragraph">Ever wondered why some web pages were flagged as not safe? That is

			<h2 class="heading-secondary">Our Longueuil web design pricing</h2>

				When shopping for a web design in Longueuil, you need to be prepared to spend at least
				$2000.
				This is the bare minimum to be expected for a
				<span class="font-bold">high-quality website</span> in Longueuil. A website is an investment
				in the long term, much like a
				house. Please be realistic with your budget and be sure to account for <span
					class="font-bold">essential website fees</span> such
				as: hosting, domain, maintenance and extra features. The more features and pages a website
				will have, the higher the cost will be.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">In average, it takes <span class="font-bold">between 3 to 6 weeks</span>
				to build a website. You can
				think
				of each website as a car with a specific
				make, model and year: not all cars cost the same, nor do they all share the same build. In
				the end, <span class="font-bold">every website is unique</span> and therefore the production
				time and
				price
				can vary considerably.</p>
